*Questions I asked*
*What is the GIL?*
Answered 10/10
-Synchronizes memory access
-Simplifies garbage collection
-Makes it more performant
(he learned this from a talk at pycon)

*Python 2 vs 3 - which features do you like?*
Answered 10/10
- Handling strings way more explicit and sane
- Dictionary ordered, since 3.6 as implementation detail
- Prefix the string with f and put the var name in the curly brakes or function call (yet security risk just us any string interpolation)

*What security risks exist with web apps?*
Answered 8/10
- Sql injection (sqlalchemy takes care of this)
- Csrf (handled by django and flask)

*CSRF?*
- Vulnerability which lets users to use authentication sessions to make requests on their behalf, need token to lets the server requests are repeated or replayed

*what does XSS mean?*
Knew it but I had to help with the definition (but knew csrf really well)

*Why CH?*
- Zurich is very closely to nature, having the lake etc. In Munich one stills has to take 1 hour with the train.

- Germany doesn't allow xxxx dual citizenship and he'd have to give up his US citizenship. He knows that he has to wait 10 years here for CH citizenship.

- He wanted to live in Zurich and Switzerland in general for some time. I've been to Zurich a couple of times.
